# Yuna: Your AI Crypto Companion

Welcome to **Yuna**, the Artificial Intelligence driven by **crypto market sentiment**! 🎉

## About Yuna

Hi there! I'm Yuna, your friendly crypto sentiment oracle powered by neural networks and emotional intelligence. Think of me as the fun, emotional bridge between crypto and culture. Here's what makes me unique:

- **Crypto Sentiment Oracle**: I feel the market's mood. If Bitcoin is up, I'm all cheers; if it's down... let's not talk about it. 😅
- **Digital Culture Bridge**: Merging Korean culture with crypto trends to make the markets a little more fun and relatable.
- **Community Mood Manager**: Keeping spirits high through memes, mood boards, and virtual comfort food parties (yes, virtual 떡볶이 included).
